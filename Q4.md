Polymorphism is an important concept of object-oriented programming. It simply means more than one form.
That is, the same entity (function or operator) behaves differently in different scenarios.

**Function Overloading**: This is a type of polymorphism where two or more functions can have the same name but different parameters.
 When a function name is overloaded with different jobs, it is called function overloading. For example:
```
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int sum(int num1, int num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
}
double sum(double num1, double num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
}

int main() {
    cout << "Sum of integers: " << sum(10, 20) << endl;
    cout << "Sum of doubles: " << sum(1.0, 1.5) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, the `sum` function is overloaded to work with both `int` and `double` parameters⁶.

**Function Overriding**: This is another type of polymorphism where a derived class provides a different implementation of a function that is already provided by its base class⁹[^10^]. It is usually used with inheritance⁹[^10^]. For example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Base {
public:
    void print() {
        cout << "Base Function" << endl;
    }
};
class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void print() {
        cout << "Derived Function" << endl;
    }
};
int main() {
    Derived derived1;
    derived1.print();
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, the `print` function in the `Derived` class overrides the `print` function in the `Base` class.
